# Kitty Kard Matching


## Project Summary

Kitty Kard Matching is a game for fans of cats and the old card game Memory. Users will enter their name and click on the cards to "flip" them displaying a picture of a cat. Users should try to find matches as quickly as possible. The game is timed and the user's time upon completion will be their final score. The best times will then be displayed at the conclusion of the game.


## Installing

This is the back end API for this application. Be sure to install and run this repo before beginning with the installing of the front end of this application.

Fork and clone this repository, then to get the back end running:

```
cd matcher_backend
rails db:create && rails db:migrate

Once the back end is set up, you can fork and clone the front end.

Be sure the back end is up and running first. Once installed, follow the instructions to start up front end:
